# Calculator

This project is a simple calculator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator also includes additional functions such as a percentage operator, an "AC" button to clear the input, and a "DEL" button to remove the last entered character. The design has been styled with CSS to provide a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface.

The logic of the calculator is implemented in JavaScript, where button clicks are captured and processed to update the display dynamically. Invalid operations are handled by showing an error message to the user, which ensures smooth functioning. This project highlights the integration of structure through HTML, styling through CSS, and interactivity through JavaScript, making it a good example of how front-end technologies work together to build an interactive web application.
